1. add a pity rate to soul drops (medium) 
	step 1: tracking down the soul drop function
		- the game stores two sets of strings for enemy names. one list for soul drops, the other list for the indicator at the bottom right
		- 0x08041338 - subroutine where the game prints a given string

		this isn't working. try a different search
		- 0x080E967A - zombie's soul rarity number
		- 0x0806848C - checks if rarity number is zero (intended for bosses)
		- 0x080684C2 - checks for soul eater ring and adds 8 to numerator if so
		- 0x080684DC - checks if soul rarity is less than 16 (evil)
		
		- 0x08068564 - checks for rare ring. i think we're in item drops now
		- 0x080684F0 - branch that skips soul creation. we found it
2. adding soul synergies (hard)
	death + red minotaur
	red crow + blue crow
	alura une + une = three mines

3. add skula and undine as ability soul entries (hard)
	leads: set a breakpoint at the ability soul name addresses and follow the subroutine to see where the ability soul definitions are stored
	then, find the subroutine that spawns a soul. hook into it to create more ability souls.

4. get crazy
